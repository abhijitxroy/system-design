Ask clarifying questions
-
    Is the interviewer looking for a design of the core features, or a high-level overview of the whole service?
    What are the constraints of the system?
    What are your assumptions? (traffic distribution, number of active users and tweets, read vs write-heavy)

Design high-level
-
    Back-of-the-envelope calculations: average KBs per tweet, size of new tweet content per month, read requests and tweets per second, etc.
    High-level components: write, read, and search APIs; types of databases; SQL vs NoSQL; etc

Drill down on your design
-
    Potential bottlenecks: adding a load balancer with multiple web servers, scalability issues, fanout service slowing down tweets and @replies, etc.
    Components that you could dive into: how a user views the home timeline or posts a tweet, the intricacies of the database design, etc.

Bring it all together
-
    Consider: does the final design address the bottlenecks youâ€™ve identified? Does it meet the goals you discussed at the beginning of the interview? Do you have any questions for the interviewer?
