#parking lot
Ask clarifying questions

Is this a multiple floor parking garage or a single level parking lot?
How many entry and exit points will be needed, and for what types of vehicles?
Are there monetary goals for this parking lot?
Design high-level

Possible use cases: customers parking and paying for their spot, admin managing the system, parking attendants maintaining the lot and helping customers, etc.
Possible classes of the system: ParkingLot, ParkingFloor, Account, ParkingTicket, Vehicle, etc.
Drill down on your design

How will you diagram specific activities? (e.g. customers paying for parking tickets, display panels showing available spots, etc.)
What are the required enums, data types, and constants of the eventual code for the parking lot system?
Bring it all together

Will this system meet the requirements youâ€™ve laid out with the interviewer in the beginning of the session?
